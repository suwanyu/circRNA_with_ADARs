#### 🔍 Highlights
- Advanced bioinformatics analysis unveiled unique regulatory patterns of circRNAs in the brain.  
- Brain circRNA transcriptome is distinct from other tissues.  
- ADARB2 enhances the synthesis of circRNAs **specifically in inhibitory neurons**.


#### 🧠 Summary
This study investigates circular RNA (circRNA) regulation with ADARB2 enrichment in inhibitory neurons. Through integrative high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis, a set of circRNAs potentially regulated by ADARB2 was identified. The findings suggest that ADARB2 promotes circRNA biogenesis in inhibitory neurons by binding to precursor RNAs.
